    <objectives>
        <skill>recall that some forces can act between objects without the objects being in contact</skill>
        <skill>recall that gravity acts between all objects that have mass</skill>
        <skill>recall that the force of gravity between two objects depends on the masses of the objects and the distance between them</skill>
        <skill>recall that the force of gravity between two objects increases if their masses are greater and decreases if the distance between them increases</skill>
        <skill>recall that gravity acts between the Sun and the planets</skill>
        <skill>recall that gravity is the force that causes planets to orbit stars, and moons to orbit planets</skill>
        <skill>recall that wherever an object experiences the force of gravity of a planet, it is said to be in that planet's gravitational field</skill>
